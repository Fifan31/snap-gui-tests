The used JRE needs to be *"instrumented"*. So it is a good idea to install a separate JRE for the testing. For not interferring with the default JRE. It should be installed to a location where the current users has write access. Proposing to install it into _user_home_.
Confirm instrumentation by clicking on "Save list"
